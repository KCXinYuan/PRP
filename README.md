# Project Red Panda

###Project Red Panda is a content management system for tracking all the bucket list items you want accomplish.  

##How it works...  
Everyone has a bucket list of things, places, or activities that they want to do before they kick the bucket. Red Panda easily allows you to track, motivate and achieve any goal that you set out to do. You can add anything to your list!    

Simply create a user account and start making your list. Red Panda's easy to use template allows you to fluidly add new bucket list items with a timeline and any desired cost. If your plans change you can update and delete any entry with a click of a button.    

##Strategic Development  
The Red Panda team used a mobile first approach when designing the application. Using Angular, Node.js, and Sass we were able to efficiently create a modular app. Test Driven Development was used to make sure that our written code was functional and accurate.  

##Red Panda development life cycle  

##Beta Stages  
The beta stages of development allow users to create new bucket list items. Users can update and delete entries that they have already created. All users must create a profile that uses authorization to allow access to administration tools. Each user will also have their very own profile page.    

##Future Releases    
Future updates of Red Panda will allow users to view other user's profiles and bucket list items. You will also be able to use customized templates which will allow you uniquely customize your own profile page. Including images of items and a completion options are planed for future releases.
